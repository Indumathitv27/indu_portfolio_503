## Projects and Publications

### Effect of COF for Recognizing Abnormality from Breast Thermograms  
*Amrita WNA, India | May 2021*  

- Developed a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) model to detect abnormalities in chest images using Google Colab.  
- Used the publicly available DMR-IR dataset for preprocessing with a Co-Occurrence Filter and segmented images using an image cropping method in Python.  
- Applied classifiers such as **KNN**, **SVM**, and **KMeans**. After comparing the outputs, **KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 83.33%** in detecting abnormalities.  

### Voice Enabled Donation Box  
*Amrita HUT Labs, India | Dec 2018*  

- Designed a donation box that plays a voice message in six different regional languages when someone passes by.  
- The initial implementation using Arduino lacked accuracy. After troubleshooting, the final version was implemented successfully using a **Raspberry Pi**, achieving the desired outcome.
